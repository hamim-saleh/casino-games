# War Rules

## Objective

The objective of the game is to wager bets against the computer in a series of rounds of a simplified version of the card game "War." The player aims to win as many rounds as possible to increase their bank balance.

## Game Setup

- Both the player and the computer start with a bank balance of 100.
- The player places a bet from their bank balance to initiate each round.

## Gameplay

In War, both the player and the computer draw a number from 1 to 10 each round. The higher number wins, earning the player a payout. Ties lead to a "war," where three more numbers are drawn. The player wins if their highest war number beats the computer's. Otherwise, they lose. If it's still a tie, the war continues until there's a winner.

# Blackjack Rules

## Objective

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer (computer) by getting a hand value closer to 21 without going over it (busting).

## Game Setup

- Both the player and the computer start with a bank balance of 100.
- The player places a bet from their bank balance to start the game.
- The player and the computer are each dealt two initial cards from a standard deck of cards, where each card is worth its face value.

## Gameplay

In Blackjack, players aim to get a hand value close to 21 without going over. They start with two cards and can choose to draw more ("hit") or keep their current hand ("stand"). Whoever gets closest to 21 without going over wins. If a player goes over 21, they lose.
